Carr writes: "It's not a sure thing, in other words, that an a la carte menu will end up giving us the widest possible array of choices. Rather than promoting the creation of a "long tail" of diverse products, unbundling may end up pushing even more economic rewards to the "hits," squeezing out a lot of the good stuff." My take: unless he's referring to the number of mediocre album tracks that piggyback on the singles, I think Carr is overestimating the amount of subsidization that actually takes place.</li>

It enabled people to move away from the “hits” of the coasts to the “long tail” of the interior, and many jumped at the opportunity. The middle of the country exploded with growth, which while far from being painless still allowed many who never could have imagined owning land or being a business owner to do just that."</li>

Excerpt: "Hines found a forgotten Louisa May Alcott story titled "Patty's Place" while looking through a 1920 copy of St. Nicholas magazine for children in the Nashville library. He published that story as "The Quiet Little Woman," along with another story he found, "Kate's Choice," and sold about 350,000 copies."</li>

The results of reality TV shows are considered "news" and show up in the headlines of the major portals (so too for sports scores). But many who watch via a DVR haven't seen it yet and it ruins the surprise. "I decided that the only way to prevent Yahoo! from spoiling sports and other shows was to never go to their homepage -- hence, no more Yahoo! search for me."</li>

Summary: "Hollywood believes large-scale broadband video distribution would only destroy proven value, fail to provide alternative value, and alter a business model that is still far from being in decline. With near-total control of the most valuable program libraries and the business models governing their distribution, a shift towards broadband media will come largely on Hollywood’s terms and at an incremental pace."</li>

As I've said before, the Long Tail is messy and has a large dynamic range of quality. That means bad comes along with the good. Fortunately we've got better and better filters to screen it out.</li>

Google benefits because it does gets paid for the occasional click.  The cost is my inventory of space, not Google’s.  So every click is gravy to Google and every exposure is value to the advertiser.  In effect, Google is GIVING AWAY exposures on my blog so that they can sell a few clicks which they will dutifully pay me for."</li>

More recently, things have started to pick up a bit as long tail forces kick in, but it still makes for sobering reading: "The best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers. Chain-store merchandising policies help turn consumers’ attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets. Independent bookstores hand-sell favorite books to their customers, whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores, inclusion in ads, and other support. Publishers’ marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than $5,000 to cover the total cost of advertising, book tours and other promotions---but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost $10,000."</li>

Therefore, the producer does not know when, if ever, the film will be released in theaters. So, unlike studio films, independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign, or used to recruit merchandising tie-ins. Independent producers therefore have only a singular product: the movie itself. To find a distributor, they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival. At that point, if the film is to succeed, it must create its own audience through reviews, awards, and word of mouth.  So, while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule, an independent producer must keep re-editing a film, no matter how long it takes, until the film works perfectly. As a result, independent films win much of the glory and awards—and studio films win most of the gold, taking in well over 80 percent of the box-office proceeds."</li>

Why pick and choose among thousands of titles that might sell only a handful of copies? Wasn’t it better to follow the formula that worked so well at airports, ordering only the top fifteen or twenty bestselling books by branded authors like Nora Roberts, Robert Ludlum, John Grisham and Stephen King? As paperback publishers awoke to the new buying patterns, they were forced to choose between star authors and those whose sales performance fell below a minimum level. At first the triaging was restricted to marginal genres like westerns, but as the last decade of the twentieth century progressed the definition of “marginal” broadened to embrace every category of book that fell below an ever-stricter definition of commerciality."</li>

I think the language bottleneck is huge to us and thus being a counter force against driving someone to a Long Tail content . For instance, only a few people read your blog while discussing about The Long Tail in Japan. I suspect that we have "translation culture" and thus, even more hit driven for English contents. This applies to mainstream media such as books, films and games. I'd be happy to hear some discussions about bottlenecks of languages towards driving demand down the tail."

There's lots of room at the very bottom: "A true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches - where there are just one, or even zero customers. You need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke, especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers. So, what businesses fit this model? The obvious one is eBay. Omidyar's model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you don't find a buyer (eBay takes a small listing fee), but works better if you do (eBay takes a percentage). Another example is cafepress. They don't even set a listing fee, working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle, and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them (they aggregate sales and pay monthly)."</li>

Traditionally, the long tail has been used to describe the number of support personnel (the tail) required to support combat troops (the tooth). Tooth-to-tail ratios have grown over the years as the complexity and resource intensity of modern combat has increased. In essence, modern warfare requires a loooong tail of support troops.

Because specialized markets are more predictable, the risk of failure is much lower, and so small-to-mid-budget movies can be very profitable indeed. In the U.S., a big-budget epic like “Troy” may have earned nearly twice as much money at the box office as “Ray” did, but, once DVD sales are included, that ratio drops to just 1.2 to 1. And, once you take into account the difference in production and marketing costs, “Ray,” a far cheaper film to make, starts to look like a truly excellent investment."</li>

It begins as a review of John Battelle's "The Search" and then segues into the connection between search and the LT: "Battelle is interested in the application of search to untapped markets, or "long tails". In the context of e-commerce, long tails have three implications. First, via the Internet, products with little demand can, collectively, create a market exceeding that of the few bestsellers. Second, in the same way that it enables a proliferation of markets, the Internet enables a proliferation of vendors. Finally, thanks to search, a shift from mass to niche markets is likely." The author notes that "the blog-powered process that [the two writers] are using may be an effective way to refine ideas and ensure their survival" but warns that it may lead to the ideas feeling a bit stale when they finally emerge in print.</li>

How the heck can we afford to keep tabs (much less influence) a 24x7 conversation with multiple millions of individual consumers? My guess is that we’ll adopt a hybrid approach, in which account teams continue to try to influence “old world” media and “strategic” blogs, as well as those growing numbers of niche-oriented blog aggregator sites. Meanwhile, we’ll develop “contextual strike teams” … The members of this class of “conversationistas” will be culled from across the agency, tasked with participating in ongoing dialogues in blogs, wikis, vlogs, et cetera, ad infinitum, not as PR people so much as “genuinely interested consumers.” </li>

The music industry is painfully making this transformation now. The movie business is fighting the change in classic innovators-dilemma style. TV doesn’t know what to do. Its viewers are leaving in droves, and the three major networks’ reaction so far is to reduce not only the cost but also the quality of programs through the reality-TV and tabloid formulas....Public radio is [in the same bind]. The real problem is coming from the fact that listeners want long-tail time-shifted content. They want to hear programs that are more meaningful to them, and they want to listen at their convenience. The entire broadcast-radio system, with its distribution, simply can’t provide what the customers want. "</li>

Paid online video and free online video. At first, the paid stuff is good and the free stuff is less good. But soon, producers seeking an audience start to make their stuff free. Because when they do, the audience goes up 100x. And then, in order to compete, others do the same thing. Wouldn't you if you had a touring band? Wouldn't you if you had already exhausted your DVD sales and wanted a big enough audience for your sequel?"</li>

Is that an event? What about the daily classes at 6pm at Hot Yoga 101 or Fred's Karate Studio? They are scheduled for a certain time, or available any time; they are activities "to do" - the public can walk in and pay a fee - are they events? And then let's look at that 49ers game. Maybe 50,000 people get tickets. Maybe a million watch it on one of several local Bay Area TV stations. So one physical event generates multiple virtual events. 150 local bars have "49ers game Sunday" special events.  When one adds all of these up -- and throws in the Meetups, the radio-controlled airplane club meetings, the church services, the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, the extension courses at local universities, the City Council of Sunnyvale public forum for comment on the new library... I consistently get numbers like 50,000 events a week in the Bay Area. Can you say Long Tail?"</li>

For example, in a search campaign where the term "sheets" may be too broad and expensive to compete effectively, tail terms such as "linen sheets" and "Egyptian cotton sheets" may yield a better performance. Why? Because tail terms contain more information about the query, and thus are more apt to directly meet the needs of the user. This equals more conversions and better brand stickiness."</li>

Obviously it depends on the market and product, but Barry looks at the example of music. "The movie studios, to their credit, use a form of dynamic pricing -- they intelligently recognize that a content item's value is highest when first released, and then subsequently fades. The music labels have mostly avoided this strategy -- but perhaps that's changing. I just noticed this little tidbit on Amazon: a long list of interesting CDs for sale on Amazon for between $6 and $10."</li>

He may be fabulously well-paid and world famous, but he is a movie star at a time when stars—and content producers in general—have less and less power over their audience."</li>

				<p>I said it would just be a few more weeks until the book was well and truly done and I could return my attention to this blog. Now that few weeks has become a month, and there's still one more week to go before I have to have the final marked-up pages and prettied-up graphics in. So it's still pretty busy here at Long Tail HQ, but the end is in sight. </p>

<p>Publication date is July 11th. Pre-orders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401302378/qid=1142823202/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-1219230-8648044?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">available now</a> (ignore the subtitle and cover image, which are both placeholders).</p>

<p>I should be properly back by the end of March. I'll start with about 60 links of interest and then update you on the latest data and research. It will be worth the wait, promise.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a few updates.</p>

<p>--I've bought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://longtail.com/">longtail.com</a> from my friends at Live365 who were, er, holding for me. (They had outbid me for in an auction with a mysterious Russian a year ago, but were great about selling it back to me at a fair price). It now resolves to this blog. </p>

<p>--I'm speaking next Friday at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.m3summit.com/">M3</a> music conference/festival in Miami. Tons of cool bands..and me (come for the bands).</p>

<p>--I've also bought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://geekdad.com/">geekdad.com</a>, where I plan to start a group blog focused on fun science/tech/math/engineering things to do with your kids, ranging from robotics to rocketry. Working motto: "Permission to play with cool toys isn't the only reason to have kids, but it's up there." Look for more in April.</p>

<p>See you soon!</p>

				<p>Stats junkies: here's more data on the end of the hit-driven music economy. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/the_decade_the__1.html">posted</a> this chart on the number of Gold (over 500,000 sold), Platinum (1-2 million), Multi-Platinum (2-10
million) and Diamond (10 million and up) albums since 1958:</p>

<p>Many of you asked to see these numbers as a proportion of total music sales, to eliminate the distorting effect of the overall growth of the music industry over that period. I finally got good sales data for the pre-Soundscan (1993) period, so here you go, with a nice polynomial curve fit to highlight the trends <span style="color: #ff3300;">[UPDATE: I've clarified the Y axis units; it's hits/total $s]</span>:</p>

<p>Second, some of you wanted more detail on the blockbuster share of box office data. Here it is, year by year, with a linear regression to show the trend:</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=428,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/blockbustertrend.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=428,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/blockbustertrend_1.jpg"><img width="450" height="301" border="0" title="Blockbustertrend_1" alt="Blockbustertrend_1" src="./The Long Tail_files/blockbustertrend_1.jpg"></a> </p>

<p></p>

<p>Third, many of you noted that domestic theatrical revenues are now just a minority share of most films' business, which is true. But it's a very good <em>proxy</em> for how those other businesses will do, because how well a film does in theaters heavily influences how well it will do in DVD and abroad. In other words, it's a safe bet that the directional trends of blockbusters as a percentage of the overall business that we're seeing in theaters are showing up in those other markets, too.</p>

<p>Finally, Nat Dykeman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/02/death_of_the_bl.html#comment-13718965">queries</a> my assertion that there's more music out there than ever before. </p><blockquote><p>During the same time that labels were crying that people were downloading their cds, and revenue was down 8%, they were quietly cutting the number of cds produced by up to 20%. Personally, I think if you cut your expenses by 20%, and your sales drop 8%, you're doing better than before.</p></blockquote><p>Another example of seeing the world through the lens of the music labels, I'm afraid. MySpace has hundreds of thousands of tracks that were never released by music labels, CD Baby has many thousands of bands who have never been signed, and likewise for the peer-to-peer networks. It's not clear whether Nat is referring to the number of CDs manufactured for each band or the number of bands signed and released. Obviously the former isn't meaningful in this discussion, and I've addressed the latter above. </p>

<p>Just to repeat, most bands aren't signed to major labels. Now that there are ways other than the labels to distribute music, such as those I've mention above, that's no longer a barrier to finding an audience. That's why there's more music than ever out there, even as the music industry--defined narrowly as the labels--shrinks.</p><blockquote><p></p></blockquote>

				<p><span style="color: #ff3300;">[UPDATE: I've revised the bottom chart, where the scale went funky for some reason, and responded to all the comments with some additional data and clarification </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/02/responses_to_bl.html"><span style="color: #ff3300;">here</span></a><span style="color: #ff3300;">.]</span></p>

<p>First, apologies for the absence. For most of the past two weeks I was at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, with a full slate of moderating duties. Then I zipped down to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://eg2006.com/">Entertainment Gathering</a> in Los Angeles, where I spoke about the end of the blockbuster. Before I share some slides from that speech, a few notes about the book.</p>

<p>The fact that I'm done with the manuscript (but not the edits, thus the late nights this week) does <em>not</em> mean that I'll be ending this blog. Just the contrary--once I'm through with this last flurry of work on the book, I hope to be blogging more often than ever. Just a few more weeks....</p>

<p>Amazon is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401302378/sr=1-1/qid=1139287839/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-1219230-8648044?%5Fencoding=UTF8">listing</a> the book for pre-order already, but please note that the subtitle and cover are not the final ones and will almost certainly change over the next few weeks. The ISBN won't so you can safely pre-order from that page (please do!). The publication date now looks like it will be June 30th.</p>

<p>Now back to the theme of this post. In my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/the_decade_the__1.html">previous</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/the_decade_the_.html">posts</a> on the death of the blockbuster, I focused on music. But for my EG speech, I added some additional research on movies. Here's some of that data:</p>

<p>At first glance, the blockbuster looks alive and well in Hollywood:</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=356,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/top100_movies.jpg"></a></p><p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=356,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/top100_movies_1.jpg"><img width="450" height="250" border="0" src="./The Long Tail_files/top100_movies_1.jpg" title="Top100_movies_1" alt="Top100_movies_1"></a>
</p> <p></p>

<p>But let's look a little closer. Box office revenues peaked a few years ago:</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=373,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/boxofficedollars.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/boxofficedollars_1.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=568,height=332,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false"><img width="450" height="263" border="0" alt="Boxofficedollars_1" title="Boxofficedollars_1" src="./The Long Tail_files/boxofficedollars_1.jpg"></a>
</p> 

<p>And that picture would have looked worse if theaters hadn't raised prices. Here's the same period expressed in terms of per capita movie theater attendance (adjusted to a constant population size):</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=364,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/boxoffice_percapita.jpg"></a></p><p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=364,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/boxoffice_percapita_1.jpg"><img width="450" height="256" border="0" src="./The Long Tail_files/boxoffice_percapita_1.jpg" title="Boxoffice_percapita_1" alt="Boxoffice_percapita_1"></a>
</p> <p></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the fraction of total box office that comes from the blockbusters (top 25 films) has been steadily falling, even as the cost of making those films (expressed here as a percentage of total box office revenue) has been rising:</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=256,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/blockbuster.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=256,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/blockbuster_1.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=260,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/blockbuster_2.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=258,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/blockbuster_3.jpg"><img width="450" height="181" border="0" title="Blockbuster_3" alt="Blockbuster_3" src="./The Long Tail_files/blockbuster_3.jpg"></a> </p>

<p>Bottom line: even in Hollywood, the home of the blockbuster, hits are losing their power. It's not nearly as dire as in music, but it's trending in the same direction. Does this mean the end of movies? Not at all--there have never been more films made, just as there has never been more music available than today, despite the fact that the bestsellers sell less. </p>

<p>It's not that people aren't watching films and listening to music, it's that they're watching <em>different</em> films and <em>different</em> music--we're just not following the herd to the same hits the way we used to. I'd guess that most of the decline in box office is due to the rise of the DVD, not a loss of interest in movies. Likewise for music, where the ubiquitous white earbuds suggest that music has never been a bigger part of our culture, despite the fact that CD sales are back to mid-90s levels. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/music/article/0,2792,DRMN_54_4439624,00.html">Here's</a> a good Denver newspaper story (pegged to the closure of a local music store) that considers the music industry after the hit. Key sentence:</p><blockquote><p>While sales are down, more music is being produced and heard than ever before in history.</p></blockquote><p>That's only a paradox if you're thinking of music through a hit-colored lens. Only a tiny faction of musicians are professionals. The rest do it because it's fun. They keep their day job and make music because they want to. Never underestimate the motivational power of fun. </p>

				<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=180,height=231,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/lego.jpg"><img width="150" height="192" border="0" src="./The Long Tail_files/lego.jpg" title="Lego" alt="Lego" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"></a>
Readers of this blog will know that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2005/10/friday_fanboy_l.html">I</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2005/10/friday_fanboy_l.html">'m a big fan of Lego</a>, both the products and the company's Long Tailish way of tapping its consumers to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.lego.com/eng/factory/design/">design new products</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.lego.com/eng/factory/gallery/default.asp">share their own creations</a>. </p>

<p>So I was really excited to hear that after five years, Lego is coming out with a new version of Mindstorms, the geeks' favorite programmable robot construction set. The new version, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=pressdetail&amp;contentid=17278&amp;countrycode=2057">which was announced this evening at CES</a>, is called Mindstorms NXT. It has a 32-bit processor, proper servo motors, new sensors (including color vision and hearing) and bluetooth connectivity so it can be controlled by a cellphone. </p>

<p>But what's really cool about the new Mindstorms is that they're a collaboration between Lego's engineers and some of the fans who run the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.lugnet.com/">very active Lego community projects</a> built around open-source versions of its software. Lego used one of the fan-designed sensors and asked other fans to help design some of the software used to program the Mindstorms. </p>

<p>Someday business schools will use this as a case study in applying Web 2.0 peer-production techniques to traditional product innovation. In the meantime, you can read all about it in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,69946-0.html?tw=wn_tophead_1">cover story from next month's Wired</a>, which we've released early as a sneak preview. <br> </p>

				<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/the_decade_the_.html#comment-12513132">Some</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/the_decade_the_.html#comment-12542619">of</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/the_decade_the_.html#comment-12546379">you</a> didn't think much of the data in my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/the_decade_the_.html">last post on the decline of the blockbuster album</a>. Two responses:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> This is, as it says at the top, a public diary of my research in progress. I freely share the data as I assemble it, including the underlying spreadsheets, so that anyone else can build on it. If you don't like my analysis, do your own and share that, too. The aim is to collectively improve the data and analysis until it's good enough to publish either in my book or elsewhere. All this is released under a Creative Commons license, which means that anyone can use it as they see fit as long as they point back here. Indeed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2006-01-03-on-demand_x.htm">USA Today did just that</a> for that last post.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> There's definitely an opportunity to make a better data-driven case that the blockbuster era has peaked. I very much look forward to other people (perhaps some who don't have a looming book deadline) grinding through the literature, building the spreadsheets and blogging the results. In the meantime, I'll do what I can. </p>

<p>Right now, I'm midway through the process of normalizing the Top 150 album data by total industry sales in each year, so it's more of an apples-to-apples comparison over the years. One problem is that I can't find total industry sales for years prior to 1990 (those since then are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.riaa.com/news/marketingdata/facts.asp">here</a>). Can anyone point me to any figures? Even a few data points in the 70s or 80s would be helpful to calibrate the curve.</p>

<p>I did find another useful resource, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp">RIAA's database</a> of Gold (over 500,000 sold), Platinum (1-2 million), Multi-Platinum (2-10 million) and Diamond (10 million and up) albums since 1958. The RIAA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.riaa.com/gp/history/default.asp">introduced</a> Platinum in 1976, Multi-Platinum in 1984, and Diamond in 1999. I ran queries for each year and compiled the numbers, combining all four categories. I now know better than to say that the statistics speak for themselves, but they certainly are interesting:</p>

<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/hitalbums.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=623,height=493,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false"><img width="449" height="356" border="0" alt="Hitalbums" title="Hitalbums" src="./The Long Tail_files/hitalbums.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>Again, the spreadsheet is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/hitalbums2.xls">here</a>.

</p>

<p>A few methodological notes. As an album goes up the charts, it gets a Gold, then a Platinum, then a Multi-Platinum and so on. So a single album may show up several times in a chart like this that combines all four categories. That tends to amplify the height of the curve after the 80s, when such multi-award winners became more common, but not wildly so: total industry sales roughly parallel that rise.<br> </p>

<p>One of the benefits of this multiple award process is that it allows us to look at a question that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060402211132/http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/the_decade_the_.html#comment-12542619">commentors</a> raised in the last post: do older albums simply have more time to become a hit, something that would bias this kind of analysis against newer albums? The answer appears to be no. If you go through the database you'll see that albums that achieved Platinum or Multi-Platinum designation almost all did so within a year of going Gold. So most of the sales do seem to be in the first year or two after release.<br> </p>
