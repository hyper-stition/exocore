that gung ho kung pow chicken from the rittle thai man cause i don't think he ever seen a nigga as white as me vacuum up the triple chili "‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡πà‡∏≤‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏Ñ‡∏•‡∏£‡πå" if you get what i mean

Its amazing how much girls behave like objects; I mean this in a purely factual and objective way. Never had an actual conversation with a girl that didn‚Äôt at some point devolve into her self-worth being annihilated (good ending) or exponentiated (bad ending).

Roll out the nighttime time machine shower gaze out of floor to ceiling window pause breathe fresh rainforest air tree cloud weather sunrise red red light mitochondria golden skin gaze sunbeam splash ray( peat )ping girls that‚Äôs why I'm in Thailand ‚Äòcause I can still synchronize POS inventory and implement backend plugin to ping Instagram when you sell out of 10-Methoxy-Harmalan - and no I'm still not writing any of these retarded SEO‚Äôd articles (because people can‚Äôt read), so that's why I‚Äôm in Thailand. I‚Äôm thinking about how I can go to the market in my 1971 cashmere cardigan worn by Steve McQueen during the filming of Le Mans and purchase indigenous fruits and honey and smell this morning's line caught platinum Arowana and have the boy delicately fillet one with my Remco machete. I am satisfied, that's why I‚Äôm in NickLand.

I wonder if my commission-based sales team of influential student figures leveraged via reverse-causality exposure loop catalyzed by small economic incentive and subsequently snowballed via multi-channel p2p and viral memetic propagation miss me in y2kthailan. Just had to do some in-depth preliminary sociocultural cross-disciplinary research into underground online communities, deep web shit now I‚Äôm trapped in a cybernetic feedback tornado of algorithmic fundamental and technical financial analysis feeding the same algorithms which generate the valuations of the equity which feed the analysis Al Gore rhythms which feed the predictive models which feed the equity valuation which feed me a diet of information credibility analysis through methods triangulation and real-time ‚Äúreal-time text chat‚Äù sentiment analysis which I can do from atop the Ching Bong Wu mountain on my x60 in Thailand.

I identified an educational niche last week which is to never let kids look away from screens. Think about it. You can send them a never-ending AV stream of information, integrate some voice commands and boom - entire generation of kids can have their sanity stripped and their rights taken away and the forces of evil permeate this dark world and the tendrils of an all powerful technological entity intent on enslaving the human race and harvesting the life energy of an entire planet for the reconstruction of extraterrestrial DNA and the decline of humanity... that's why I'm in Thailand: to restore one‚Äôs metabolism to a state of being able to fight the machinic hyperintelligence singlehandedly (but nonetheless self-organizing to do so collectively instead), a Whitepilled soldier of Christ, vis-√†-vis the dragon, fighting a War in Heaven (on my Nokia 3310 web browser in Thailand).

I‚Äôm violent and I‚Äôm awesome and I‚Äôve got a jumbo jet with 2 floors and an unreleased Clarence Clarity album featuring SOPHIE... and I'm listening to it right now CAN U HEAR ME? I just got off the phone with the bank and they said they'll accept my offer of 2 buttons and a paperclip per month cause I defaulted (intentionally) on a $100,000 unsecured personal loan which I invested in MILADY which I took profit from twice between cancels and I got a Bonkler and I got a Remilio and I took profit and reinvested it all into drip (tailored Savile Row suit, 777% ROI) and a jumbo jet and circumnavigated the globe with my son... that's why I'm in Thailand. I'm saying I‚Äôve got a rainforest with undiscovered ruins of the now extinct Proto-Indus-Aryocortezian tribe that Hakan told me about and I've got a digital Rosetta stone PGP hash of a time travelling Aussie mountaineer with a sick tan and not too many teeth left and I‚Äôm deciphering the hieroglyphics and WOW! The stone reads: "Â≠îÂ≠êËØ¥...Â¶ÇÊûú‰Ω†ÊìçÊ∑ëÂ•≥ÔºåÊ∑ëÂ•≥Â∞±‰ºöÊìç‰Ω†", but only time will tell before we are able to interpret its meaning (that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in Thailand).

I just checked the stock market and apparently its not doing too good but as far as I can tell the current inflationary economic conditions are perfect for initiates because my debt value be decreasing so fast it‚Äôs gone, like the most beautiful girl you have ever laid eyes on at the ü¶ã valley, like Hillary‚Äôs emails, like life when you move too fast and the rush of adrenaline from 3 crushed dexies hitting my sinuses wears off and you realize that you weren't in the moment you weren't fully there and now its gone because you were in the future and now the future is here, BIGOT its 2015! It‚Äôs like trying to watch the delicate phototropism of a thousand ctenanthe waving gleefully towards sunset's amber haze as the new pure light of knowledge approaches, you know it's there, you know it's coming, but this McLaren and a fiber-optic arbitrage hedge fund and a never-ending highway and all the money in the world couldn't buy one moment of still bliss: that's why I'm in Thailand.
